## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Yeoman ives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

#### Install Node/npm (the clean way)

If you intent to do frontend development with `npm`, it is recommended you setup a usable development environment with the help of [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

In order to use *nvm* you need to uninstall/remove any previously installed Node/npm versions. Follow the instructions on [npmjs.com](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/removing-npm) or remove all traces of Node and npm by running the commands found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11177954/how-do-i-completely-uninstall-node-js-and-reinstall-from-beginning-mac-os-x/11178106#11178106).

Then issue the following command to **install nvm**:

```bash
$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.24.0/install.sh | bash
```

Setup the installed **node version manager** by sourcing the setup to your shell:

```bash
$ source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

Note: to make this setting persist, add the source line to your `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile`. You can also create a file `~/.nvmrc` in your home folder containing a version number, e.g.`0.12.0`:

```bash
$ cat ~/.nvmrc
0.12.0
```

After you have setup **npm** just open a Terminal window and install YEOMAN:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

Done and ready to go!

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.
